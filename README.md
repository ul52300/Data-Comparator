**(NOTE: You MUST use an Excel that is not heavily modified from the original template.)**

Once you have selected your Excel document, you will now have to load in the sheets of the Excel. These sheets will represent what technology and band you want to check. (I.E. GSM 850, W-CDMA BV, LTE B5, etc.)
Please click on **'Load'**. This will load your sheets into the dropdown list, where you will select the technology and band.

**(NOTE: You MUST hit 'Load' every time you enter a new Excel. If you don't the program will crash because it thinks you are using the previous Excel's sheets when you are using one that potentially does not exist in the newly selected Excel.)**

After you have entered BOTH the Excel and loaded in the sheet you want to see, you can now display the data on the table by hitting **'Load Excel'**.
