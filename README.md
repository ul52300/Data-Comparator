You are able to select the Excel sheet and Microsoft Docx individually if you want to just check either or both.

### 1) Loading in an Sheet from Excel:

By clicking on **'Browse'** you can browse your Windows filebrowser to find the Excel with the data that you want to check.

**(NOTE: You MUST use an Excel that is not heavily modified from the original template.)**

Once you have selected your Excel document, you will now have to load in the sheets of the Excel. These sheets will represent what technology and band you want to check. (I.E. GSM 850, W-CDMA BV, LTE B5, etc.)
Please click on **'Load'**. This will load your sheets into the dropdown list, where you will select the technology and band.

**(NOTE: You MUST hit 'Load' every time you enter a new Excel. If you don't the program will crash because it thinks you are using the previous Excel's sheets when you are using one that potentially does not exist in the newly selected Excel.)**

After you have entered BOTH the Excel and loaded in the sheet you want to see, you can now display the data on the table by hitting **'Load Excel'**.

This will be the final result if everything was entered correctly:

### 2) Loading in a Microsoft Docx:

By clicking on **'Browse'** you can browse your Windows filebrowser to find the Microsoft Docx with the data that you want to check.

**(NOTE: The Microsoft Docx with the plots MUST be formatted to the standard way that the SAR department plots data.)**

Once you have selected your Microsoft Docx you can now load in the data into the table. There is no need to load the technology and band since this is all in the plot.
